You can use the source code from this repo to make your first app! 
The simple app is functional where the nice app is a styled version of the simple app.

To deploy, I suggest heroku. You will need to make a change or two to the code in this repo and do
lots of CLI commands for the heroku app. Instructions from Dash are here:

And heroku-specific deployment is here:
