# dash_talk

I haven't made this! But I'll have this up with Heroku instructions *hopefully* by the end of the day on  4/15

Edit:

I still haven't made this yet. I got my app to deploy just haven't gotten around to making instructions for it yet

Basically if you follow this guide (from dash): https://dash.plot.ly/deployment
It will get you all the way there. Two things I've noticed though are that you don't need to make a seperate flask server, 
you can call that variable directly from your dash app. And the other thing I've noticed is that the virtualenv wasn't
necessary to get my app to run. Although it's probably a good practice to include it.
